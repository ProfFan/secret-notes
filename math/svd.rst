Singular Value Decomposition
============================

This is also very hard.

.. proof:definition:: Left triangle

   A *left triangle* is a triangle in which one angle is a left angle.

.. _righttriangle:

.. proof:definition:: Right triangle

   A *right triangle* is a triangle in which one angle is a right angle.

.. _pythagorean:

.. proof:theorem:: Pythagorean theorem

   In a :ref:`righttriangle`, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

.. _pyth_proof:

.. proof:proof:: Pythagorean theorem

   The proof is left to the reader.

You can label and reference definition and theorems (e.g. :numref:`theorem {number} <pythagorean>`). You can also reference proofs (see the :ref:`proof of the Pythagorean theorem <pyth_proof>`).
