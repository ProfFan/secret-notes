.. proof:definition:: Left triangle

   A *left triangle* is a triangle in which one angle is a left angle.

.. _righttriangle:

.. proof:definition:: Right triangle

   A *right triangle* is a triangle in which one angle is a right angle.

.. _pythagorean:

.. proof:theorem:: Pythagorean theorem

         \color{red}{x^2}+y^2=3
         :label: eq_c

.. _pyth_proof:

.. proof:proof:: Pythagorean theorem

   The proof is left to the reader.

You can label and reference definition and theorems (e.g. :numref:`theorem {number} <pythagorean>`). You can also reference proofs (see the :ref:`proof of the Pythagorean theorem <pyth_proof>`).
